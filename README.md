# OBJECTIVE: Create a SQL server database and use it for different projects of the present github profile.
The file **SQL_server_installation.txt** describes the installation procedure. I used this postreSQL server for
* Extract Transfer Load (ETL) Spark pipeline (for details see [toSQL.scala]([https://github.com/PavelPll/Hadoop-HIVE](https://github.com/PavelPll/Spark-ETL-ML/blob/main/Scala_ETL/toSQL.scala)).  
* For spark streaming (for details see [toSQLstreaming.scala](https://github.com/PavelPll/Spark-ETL-ML/blob/main/Streaming/src/main/scala/toSQLstreaming.scala)).
* The folder **./Java_ML** contains the example of simple machine learning pipeline in Java.
* The example of data batch processing with Spark (**./Streaming**).
> [!NOTE]
> Each project is accompained by intsruction how to run it on Spark cluster in Scala, Java or in Python environment (see the corresponding **How_to_run.txt** files).
