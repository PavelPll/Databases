# OBJECTIVE: Install MongoDB database and use it for Sentiment analysis project in the current GitHub repository.
Fot technical reasons, I put MongoDB part in the [Sentiment Analysis project](https://github.com/PavelPll/Sentiment_ETL_Analysis) of the current GitHub. The file, **docker-compose.yml**, run two MongoDB containers and one container with jupyter notebook installed. The first container, my_mongo, is used to store the data (my_mongo:27017). The second one, mongo-express, is used for MongoDB Graphic User Interface (http://localhost:8081).
